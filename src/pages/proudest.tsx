            This was hard to narrow down, because I'm generally proud of:
            whatever my coworkers give me a pat on the back for (and who doesn't
            love a good "atta boy!"), or when I overcome some technical
            challenge (which to be fair usually just means chasing down some
            stupid bug, or finding some workaround for a package that became
            incompatible after an update).

          <p className="mb-4 ">
            In other words, anyone not familiar with the problem or journey is
            unlikely to find some code snippet or other impressive without the
            context. Having said that, I do have something I'm proud of that I
            can show; where my solution was well received and where the context
            can be communicate easily enough...

          <p className="mb-6">
            My task was to redo components that made up various web crawler
            setup pages that the end user interacted with. This was for a
            company that creates web scrapers that extract data from various
            social media sites.

            For each new crawler added to their library a dev has to create the
            settings page for the end-user. My objective was to bring a cleaner
            aesthetic to the settings pages with new components that the devs
            could use to quickly build settings pages for new crawlers and
            integrations.

          <h2 className="text-2xl mb-5 mt-10 font-bold">The Solution</h2>
          <p className="mb-6">
            I've done several things to improve the user experience and help
            reduce the high first-time user churn, but the custom range slider
            is what I'm most proud of:

              Redesigned Outreach Section with range slider that changes maximum
              value based on the selected send schedule.

          <h2 className="text-2xl mb-5 mt-10 font-bold">Why I'm proud of it</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Well first, it was surprisingly difficult to style the native range
            slider, so overcoming that hurdle made me proud of my work ðŸ”¥.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Then then range input itself was well-received, because there were
            many unintuitive rectangular number inputs that this new component
            could now replace.
          </p>

          <p className="">
            I made it flexible, so devs could use a color variant to suggest to
            users which settings they should avoid tweaking, and which they are
            encouraged to change. Size variants, the input encourages the user
            to provide a small or a large number (and use up them usage-credits,
            baby!).
